# QuizMaker
This is the official Website for The FameMedia QuizMaker. The software is called Quiz {YEAR}. For example: Quiz 2015 or Quiz 2016.
The Quiz Maker( and Viewer ) is completely written in Python 3
Python 3 has only a few changes from Python 2 (e.g. Use print(string) instead of print string).
So all peolple who are programming in Python 2 can program in Python 2.
You can also download the software as compiled exe files. (Even if you arenÂ´t a developer)

# Installation of compiled version

After you have downloaded and unpacked the files you should find a setup(.exe) in your directory. Execute it (with admin rights if you want to install it to C:\Program Files. If you dont have admin rights choose a directory like C:\Quiz 2015).
Now follow the steps. The license you will see is an old license. The key is ABCD - EFGH - IJKL - MNOP

# Installation of uncompiled version

You simply have to unpack it to a directory like C:\Quiz 2015
